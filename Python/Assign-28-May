## 1.Write python program to perform bank operations using class and objects.

Conditions:
        a.Bank name should be static.
        
        b.Using menu driven program.
        
        1. Deposit
        
        2. Withdraw
        
        3. Exit



class Bank:

    Bank_name = 'HDFC'
    
    def __init__(self):
    
        self.balance = 0.0


    def Deposit(self,Name):
    
        Amt = float(input("Enter Amount to Deposit:"))
        
        self.balance += Amt
        
        print(Name," your Account balamce is ",self.balance)

    def Withdraw(self,Name):
    
        Amt = float(input("Enter Amount to Withdraw:"))
        
        if Amt > self.balance:
        
            print("Awkat dekh ke Amount dal be")
            
        else:    
        
            self.balance -= Amt
            
            print(Name," your Account balance is ",self.balance)


   


Opp = Bank()

while True:

    N = int(input("Enter Choice 1:Deposit , 2:Withdraw , 3:Exit"))
    
    if N==1:
    
        Opp.Deposit('Suraj')
        
        print(Bank.Bank_name)
        
    elif N==2:
    
        Opp.Withdraw('Suraj')
        
        print(Bank.Bank_name)
        
    elif N==3:
    
        quit()




## 2 Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and
## two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.


class Circle:

    def __init__(self):
    
        self.pi = 3.14
        
    def Circle_Area(self,r):
    
        Area = self.pi*(r**2)
        
        print(Area)
        

    def Perimeter_Circle(self,r):
    
        Perimeter = 2*self.pi*(r)
        
        print(Perimeter)
        
        

cal = Circle()


cal.Circle_Area(2)

cal.Perimeter_Circle(2)
        

## 3 Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area
## function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.
     
class Shape:

    def __init__(self):
    
        pass
        
    def area(self):
    
        return 0
        
class Square:

    def __init__(self,l):
    
        super().__init__()
        
        self.length = l
        

    def area(self):
    
        return self.length*self.length

s =Square(3)

print("the area of square",s.area())


## 4 Write a program to count how many reference variables in a program. 


import sys

class ref_count():

    def reference(self):
    
        print("A")


H1 = ref_count()

s1 = H1

print(sys.getrefcount(H1))


## 5 write any program to achieve composition in Python

class Salary:

    def __init__(self,pay,bonus):
    
        self.pay = pay
        
        self.bonus= bonus
        

    def annual_salary(self):
    
        return (self.pay*12)+self.bonus

class employee:

    def __init__(self,name,age,pay,bonus):
    
        self.name = name
        
        self.age = age
        
        self.obj_salary=Salary(pay,bonus)

    def total_salary(self):
    
        return self.obj_salary.annual_salary()

emp = employee('max',25,2500,10000)

print(emp.total_salary())
